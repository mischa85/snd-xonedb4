# snd-xonedb4

This is a driver for several Ploytec audio/MIDI interfaces. It supports both BULK and INTERRUPT streaming modes.

The development of the macOS driverkit driver has been an unpleasant experience to say the least. Apart from the largely undocumented functions and the severe lack of examples, which made the development a hell, there are many issues regarding the codesigning. Of course it would be easier if I could just make a signed binary available, but as Apple wants $99/year for this I kindly refuse to pay that out of my own pocket. If anyone is able to get me one of those I'll start supplying a signed binary for the driver.
