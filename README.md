# 🎛️ Ozzy - USB Audio & MIDI Driver for Non-Class Compliant Devices

**Bringing legacy professional audio hardware back to life.**

Modern operating systems dropped support for non-class compliant USB audio devices—hardware that doesn't follow the standard USB Audio Class specification. These devices require vendor-specific drivers, and when manufacturers abandon them, perfectly good professional equipment becomes unusable.

Ozzy fixes that.

This is an open-source, reverse-engineered driver supporting non-class compliant USB audio interfaces—high-end DJ mixers and audio processors that were left behind when official driver support ended.

**Currently Supported Devices:**
* **Allen & Heath Xone:DB4, DB2, DX, 4D** (Ploytec-based protocol)

More devices can be added—the architecture separates the audio engine from device protocols.

---

## 🚀 What Makes These Devices Non-Class Compliant?

Standard USB Audio Class devices work automatically with any modern OS—they follow a universal protocol. But professional hardware often needs:

* **Custom audio routing** beyond simple stereo in/out
* **Hardware-specific DSP control** and mixer integration  
* **Proprietary USB protocols** for low-latency performance
* **Special MIDI implementations** for controller integration

These devices never worked with generic OS drivers. They **require** vendor-specific drivers. When vendors stop supporting them, the hardware stops working on new OS versions.

Ozzy reverses the protocol and provides modern drivers—so your equipment keeps working.

## 🖥️ Platform Support

Ozzy provides **native kernel-mode drivers** for maximum performance and compatibility.

### 🍎 macOS (Multiple Backend Options)
Flexible architecture supporting three backend implementations:

**Current: Kernel Extension (Kext)** - *Recommended*
* **Audio:** 8×8 channels via CoreAudio HAL
* **MIDI:** Full CoreMIDI support with lock-free ring buffers
* **Latency:** Sub-millisecond performance via zero-copy ring buffers
* **Requirements:** macOS 11+, SIP modified for kext loading (`csrutil enable --without kext`)
* **Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and stable

**Planned: DriverKit Extension (Dext)**
* Modern sandboxed system extension
* Requires Apple entitlements for production use
* Same performance as kext, future-proof architecture
* **Status:** 🚧 In development (legacy prototype in `legacy/mac-coreaudio/`)

**Planned: Userspace Daemon**
* No kernel extension required
* Works with full SIP enabled
* Slightly higher latency but maximum compatibility
* **Status:** 🚧 Planned

All backends share the same CoreAudio HAL and CoreMIDI drivers—only the USB communication layer changes. Choose the backend that fits your security and performance requirements.

**Location:** [`macos/`](macos/)

### 🐧 Linux (ALSA Kernel Module)
Standard ALSA kernel module with automatic transfer mode detection.
* **Audio:** 8×8 channels (PCM)
* **MIDI:** ALSA Sequencer In/Out
* **Modes:** Automatic BULK/INTERRUPT transfer detection
* **Integration:** Works seamlessly with JACK, PulseAudio, PipeWire
* **Location:** [`linux/`](linux/)

### 🪟 Windows
*Coming soon.* WASAPI kernel-mode driver in development.

**Why kernel mode?**  
Non-class compliant devices need direct USB pipe access and precise timing that's only possible in kernel space. User-space solutions add latency and complexity—kernel drivers provide the clean, low-latency performance these professional devices were designed for.

## 🏗️ Building from Source (The "Signing" Pain)

If you are a developer or want to build the latest code, you **must** code-sign the macOS binaries.

### 1. Get a Free Signing Identity
You do not need a paid Apple Developer program membership ($99/yr). A free Apple ID works fine.
1. Open **Xcode**.
2. Go to **Settings (Cmd+,)** -> **Accounts**.
3. Click the **`+`** button and add your Apple ID.
4. Select your Personal Team.
5. Click **Manage Certificates...**.
6. Click the **`+`** in the bottom left and select **Apple Development**.
7. Wait for it to say "Created". You now have a valid certificate in your Keychain.

### 2. Build & Install
Run the build script. It will auto-detect your new certificate:
```bash
./macos/install.command
```

### 🔑 "0 valid identities found"

This is the most common build error. It means `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` returns nothing, even though you added your account in Xcode. **This is an Apple Keychain/certificate chain-of-trust issue, not an Ozzy issue.** Work through the fixes below in order.

> Apple's codesigning infrastructure has several long-standing pain points. The WWDR G1 intermediate certificate expired in February 2023 and broke codesigning for millions of developers — Xcode's automatic certificate management didn't handle the transition cleanly, and machines restored from backup or migrated via Time Machine still carry the expired cert. Keychain Access has a UX trap where right-clicking a certificate and choosing "Always Trust" (the natural instinct when you see a warning) silently adds a custom trust policy that makes `security find-identity` reject it — with no indication that you just broke codesigning. Free Apple Development certificates expire after one year with no notification outside of Xcode. And when things go wrong, the error messages are useless — "0 valid identities found" tells you nothing about *why*. This isn't going away; it's been like this since at least 2016.

#### Diagnose First

Open **Keychain Access**, find your **"Apple Development: [Your Name]"** certificate, and check:
- Does it have a **disclosure triangle** (▶) next to it? If not, the **private key is missing** — see Fix 4.
- Does it show a **red ✕** or say **"This certificate has an invalid issuer"**? The intermediate certificate is missing or expired — see Fix 2.
- Does it say **"This certificate is marked as trusted for all users"**? You hit the trust trap — see Fix 1.

You can also run a formal evaluation: select the certificate, then go to **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Evaluate** and choose **Generic (certificate chain validation only)**. This will tell you exactly what's broken.

#### Fix 1: The "Trust" Trap (Most Common)

Did you (or someone troubleshooting) manually change the certificate trust settings in Keychain Access?

1. Open **Keychain Access**.
2. Find your **"Apple Development: [Your Name]"** certificate.
3. Right-click -> **Get Info**.
4. Expand the **Trust** section.
5. **CRITICAL:** Set everything to **"Use System Defaults"**.

If this was set to "Always Trust", macOS adds a custom trust policy that *breaks* the codesign toolchain. The certificate may *look* valid but `security find-identity` will reject it. It must stay on "System Defaults".

#### Fix 2: Missing or Expired WWDR Intermediate Certificate

Your signing certificate is issued by Apple's **Worldwide Developer Relations (WWDR)** intermediate authority. If that intermediate is missing, expired, or the wrong generation, macOS can't build the certificate chain and your identity becomes invisible.

The old WWDR intermediate (G1) **expired February 7, 2023**. If you see it in your keychain with a red ✕, that's the problem.

**To fix:**
1. Open **Keychain Access** and enable **View > Show Expired Certificates**.
2. Delete any expired **"Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority"** entries.
3. Download the current intermediates from [Apple's Certificate Authority page](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/). You need **WWDR G3** (for development certificates) — direct link:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
   open AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
   ```
4. Double-click to install, or drag into Keychain Access under the **login** keychain.
5. Verify: the certificate should show **"Expires: 2030"** and no red warnings.

If you're on **Xcode 11.4.1 or later**, Xcode should download this automatically — but it often doesn't, especially after a clean macOS install or migration.

#### Fix 3: Certificate Expired

Signing certificates themselves expire (typically after 1 year for free Apple Development certificates).

1. In Keychain Access, select your certificate and check the **Expires** field.
2. If expired, delete it.
3. Recreate via Xcode: **Settings > Accounts > Manage Certificates > + > Apple Development**.

#### Fix 4: Missing Private Key

A signing identity requires both the certificate AND its private key. If you migrated to a new Mac, restored from backup, or created the certificate on a different machine, the private key may not have come along.

**How to check:** In Keychain Access, click the certificate. If there's a **disclosure triangle** (▶) and you can expand it to see a private key — you're fine. If there's no triangle, the private key is missing.

**To fix:** You must delete the orphaned certificate and create a new one via Xcode (step 1 above). Private keys cannot be recovered — they can only be exported from the original machine.

#### Fix 5: Nuclear Option — Start Fresh

If nothing above works:
1. In Keychain Access, delete ALL certificates containing "Apple Development" or "Developer ID" from both **login** and **System** keychains.
2. Delete expired WWDR intermediates (see Fix 2).
3. Download and install fresh WWDR G3 intermediate.
4. Open **Xcode > Settings > Accounts**, remove and re-add your Apple ID.
5. Click **Manage Certificates > + > Apple Development**.
6. Verify: `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` should now show your identity.

## 🛠️ For Developers

Ozzy is designed as a **reference implementation** for supporting non-class compliant USB audio devices.

### Why This Matters

Most USB audio driver examples you'll find online are either:
- **Class-compliant only** - They work with standard UAC devices but can't handle vendor protocols
- **User-space hacks** - They add latency and complexity to work around kernel restrictions
- **Closed source** - Manufacturers don't share how their protocols work

Ozzy provides a **clean, open-source example** of how to:

* **Reverse engineer** vendor-specific USB audio protocols
* **Implement kernel drivers** for direct USB pipe access
* **Build zero-copy architectures** with shared memory ring buffers
* **Support multiple platforms** with a shared protocol layer

### Architecture Highlights

- **Device-agnostic core:** The audio engine (`OzzyCore`) is separated from device protocol implementations, making it easy to support additional vendors
- **Platform-portable:** Linux and macOS implementations share the USB protocol code
- **Performance-first:** No unnecessary data copies, context switches, or latency-inducing abstractions
- **Lock-free design:** Ring buffers use atomic operations for thread-safe, real-time audio

### Repository Structure

```

Whether you need to support your own legacy hardware or understand how professional audio drivers work, this codebase provides a solid foundation.
