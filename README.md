# 🎛️ Ozzy - USB Audio & MIDI Driver for Non-Class Compliant Devices

**Bringing legacy professional audio hardware back to life.**

Modern operating systems dropped support for non-class compliant USB audio devices—hardware that doesn't follow the standard USB Audio Class specification. These devices require vendor-specific drivers, and when manufacturers abandon them, perfectly good professional equipment becomes unusable.

Ozzy fixes that.

This is an open-source, reverse-engineered driver supporting non-class compliant USB audio interfaces—high-end DJ mixers and audio processors that were left behind when official driver support ended.

**Currently Supported Devices:**
* **Allen & Heath Xone:DB4, DB2, DX, 4D** (Ploytec-based protocol)

More devices can be added—the architecture separates the audio engine from device protocols.

---

## 🚀 What Makes These Devices Non-Class Compliant?

Standard USB Audio Class devices work automatically with any modern OS—they follow a universal protocol. But professional hardware often needs:

* **Custom audio routing** beyond simple stereo in/out
* **Hardware-specific DSP control** and mixer integration  
* **Proprietary USB protocols** for low-latency performance
* **Special MIDI implementations** for controller integration

These devices never worked with generic OS drivers. They **require** vendor-specific drivers. When vendors stop supporting them, the hardware stops working on new OS versions.

Ozzy reverses the protocol and provides modern drivers—so your equipment keeps working.

| Device | Channels | Sample Rates | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Allen & Heath Xone:DB4** | 8×8 | 44.1/48/88.2/96 kHz | ✅ Perfect |
| **Allen & Heath Xone:DB2** | 8×8 | 44.1/48/88.2/96 kHz | ✅ Perfect |
| **Allen & Heath Xone:DX** | 8×8 | 44.1/48/88.2/96 kHz | ✅ Perfect |
| **Allen & Heath Xone:4D** | 8×8 | 44.1/48/88.2/96 kHz | ✅ Perfect |

## 🖥️ Platform Support

Ozzy provides **native kernel-mode drivers** for maximum performance and compatibility.

### 🍎 macOS (Multiple Backend Options)
Flexible architecture supporting three backend implementations:

**Current: Kernel Extension (Kext)** - *Recommended*
* **Audio:** 8×8 channels via CoreAudio HAL
* **MIDI:** Full CoreMIDI support with lock-free ring buffers
* **Latency:** Sub-millisecond performance via zero-copy ring buffers
* **Requirements:** macOS 11+, SIP modified for kext loading (`csrutil enable --without kext`)
* **Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and stable

**Planned: DriverKit Extension (Dext)**
* Modern sandboxed system extension
* Requires Apple entitlements for production use
* Same performance as kext, future-proof architecture
* **Status:** 🚧 In development (legacy prototype in `legacy/mac-coreaudio/`)

**Planned: Userspace Daemon**
* No kernel extension required
* Works with full SIP enabled
* Slightly higher latency but maximum compatibility
* **Status:** 🚧 Planned

All backends share the same CoreAudio HAL and CoreMIDI drivers—only the USB communication layer changes. Choose the backend that fits your security and performance requirements.

**Location:** [`macos/`](macos/)

### 🐧 Linux (ALSA Kernel Module)
Standard ALSA kernel module with automatic transfer mode detection.
* **Audio:** 8×8 channels (PCM)
* **MIDI:** ALSA Sequencer In/Out
* **Modes:** Automatic BULK/INTERRUPT transfer detection
* **Integration:** Works seamlessly with JACK, PulseAudio, PipeWire
* **Location:** [`linux/`](linux/)

### 🪟 Windows
*Coming soon.* WASAPI kernel-mode driver in development.

**Why kernel mode?**  
Non-class compliant devices need direct USB pipe access and precise timing that's only possible in kernel space. User-space solutions add latency and complexity—kernel drivers provide the clean, low-latency performance these professional devices were designed for.

## 💿 Installation

### 🍎 macOS

**Quick Install:**
1. Open Terminal and navigate to the `macos/` directory
2. Run: `./install.command`
3. Enter your password when prompted
4. Plug in your mixer

The installer automatically:
- ✅ Checks SIP configuration
- ✅ Compiles the kernel extension
- ✅ Builds HAL and MIDI drivers
- ✅ Installs to system directories
- ✅ Configures auto-loading at boot
- ✅ Starts drivers immediately

**Requirements:**
- macOS 11+ (Big Sur or later)
- SIP modification: Run `csrutil enable --without kext` in Recovery Mode
- Apple Developer certificate in Keychain (free Apple ID works)

**Uninstall:** Run `macos/uninstall.command`

**Troubleshooting:** Run `macos/debuglogs.command` to collect diagnostic logs

For detailed information, see [macos/README.md](macos/README.md)

### 🐧 Linux

1.  Clone and build:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mischa85/snd-xonedb4
    cd snd-xonedb4
    sudo ./install_linux.sh
    ```
2.  That's it. We even reload the module for you.

## 🏗️ Building from Source (The "Signing" Pain)

If you are a developer or want to build the latest code, you **must** code-sign the binaries.

```bash
cd linux
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe snd-xonedb4
```

**Uninstall:** Run `linux/uninstall.sh`

## 🛠️ For Developers

Ozzy is designed as a **reference implementation** for supporting non-class compliant USB audio devices.

### Why This Matters

Most USB audio driver examples you'll find online are either:
- **Class-compliant only** - They work with standard UAC devices but can't handle vendor protocols
- **User-space hacks** - They add latency and complexity to work around kernel restrictions
- **Closed source** - Manufacturers don't share how their protocols work

Ozzy provides a **clean, open-source example** of how to:

* **Reverse engineer** vendor-specific USB audio protocols
* **Implement kernel drivers** for direct USB pipe access
* **Build zero-copy architectures** with shared memory ring buffers
* **Support multiple platforms** with a shared protocol layer

### Architecture Highlights

- **Device-agnostic core:** The audio engine (`OzzyCore`) is separated from device protocol implementations, making it easy to support additional vendors
- **Platform-portable:** Linux and macOS implementations share the USB protocol code
- **Performance-first:** No unnecessary data copies, context switches, or latency-inducing abstractions
- **Lock-free design:** Ring buffers use atomic operations for thread-safe, real-time audio

### Repository Structure

Whether you need to support your own legacy hardware or understand how professional audio drivers work, this codebase provides a solid foundation.

## 📜 Legacy Implementations

The [`legacy/`](legacy/) directory contains archived driver implementations:

- **mac-coreaudio/** - DriverKit-based system extension (requires SIP disabled)
- **mac-hal/** - Early user-space HAL plugin experiments
- Old installation scripts and utilities

These are kept for reference but are not actively maintained.
